                                Digital-native objects operate very differently to both analogue and digitized documents, and so old conceptions of the Archive
                                and of evidence must be reevaluated within the lens of these new objects' specific characteristics. How 
                                can these objects enter into the historian's matrix of evidence?
                            </li>

                                Forms of digital archival can extend beyond the bounds of the traditional Archive format and its restrictions
                                 due to their 
                                inherent portability, but this comes at the sacrifice of validity and provenance. How can we reconcile a
                                more democratic archive with historian's need for consistent and academically viable evidence?

                                How can we ensure digital objects can be preserved in an archive-compatible format? We endeavour to develop a 
                                database schema and metadata standard to establish a starting point, focusing on metadata information that is
                                important and necessary for historians.

                                We also intend to demonstrate this databasing system with existing forum platforms, with the future 
                                goal of developing an open-source, community-run archival dataset system, in which hobbyist archvists and intitutions
                                alike can develope their own digital datasets that are interoperable with each other.
