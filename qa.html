                Q. How and why did you come to this kind of research?</p>
             
             
                <p>
                    A. I'm a preservationist by blood, and a "historian" by semi-voluntary trade. 
                    At times it's been difficult to grasp the historical concepts I want to zero in on with this project.
                    There's many ways to justify a new archival format, and not all of them are concerned with a modality change.

                    <br>
                    <br>

                    I don't think I set out to be radical with my research. As I said before, the arrangement was semi-voluntary
                    in that I hadn't really considered a postgrad career in modern history. In fact, after five years at university and
                    a double degree at the end of that, I wasn't considering postgrad at all.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    So it was a bit of a fish out of water moment, to start an MRes in my minor subject. My main issue was finding a topic area. At the
                    beginning of the year I tentatively felt out "future history" as a concept, because I felt like history is being lost
                    all the time, and I wanted to hash out what it would mean to be a historian 50 or 100 years from now. I am by nature a collector of "weird stuff" that people generally do not care about, and a long-time personal interest
                    is that of niche online discussion spaces, so that's also been a large influence on taking this topic area on.

                    Q. What are you hoping your research will achieve?</p>
            
                <p>

                    A. Realistically, I just want <i>some</i> academic presence in this area that isn't focused on the politics of it. Not to suggest
                    that's irrelevant, it isn't, it's just that the whole concept of the web and its mechanics aren't being considered in the way it 
                    constitutes historical evidence. I suspect this is because the intersection of those STEM-inclined enough to understand its rudimentary
                    features are less likely to be historians and vice versa. Even archivists aren't particulatly up to date, but I forgive them more -
                    they have their own problems with physical evidence let alone anything more complicated than that.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Without that requisite knowledge of the hardware and software stacks that follow the Internet from its host server to the end user 
                    (you), it's very difficult to talk about how we use it as historical evidence in a more critical sense. It's a matter of simple
                    ignorance, really. When historians do try to talk about this issue (which has become increasingly relevant as digitized physical documents
                    become more and more a part of the way historians access evidence), a lot of liberties are taken and a lot of things are just simply
                    assumed. The worst and most pervasive assumption is the that the Internet <i>is</i> an archive, which is an assumption that is both 
                    silly and dangerous.

                    Recently for a unit I read a piece about the new frontier the Web could provide for academics and historians - written in 2004. (As an
                    aside, our way of thinking has hardly changed since that piece was written. Certainly we haven't achieved much more in terms of actual 
                    methodological principle, just lofty assurances). This piece links to an online resource to demonstrate something - and somewhere in
                    the long chain of poorly done data migration that plagues most server operators, most of all universities and companies - this resource 
                    is now gone. 'Link rot' is a major problem, especially in the digital jornalism space. Journal articles from as recent as two years ago
                    are borderline unusable because the hyperlinks they used to demonstrate points or point to other articles, quotes, or other evidence now
                    lead to nowhere. The interoperability of the Internet that was a boon for journalists to maximise their informative potential is now what
                    renders their efforts borderline useless. Independent fact checking in this case can become difficult - though I suspect this is more a 
                    feature than a bug.

                    <br>

                    Excuse me, I digress. Obviously what I have just described presents a problem for the historian both in the near present and the far future.
