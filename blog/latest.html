        We're pulling in now to the final weeks of semester: the worst and the best time.
        Progress on the research proposal has been like walking through molasses for the last 2 months,
        but it's ramping up nicely. Most of the administrative elements are done.

        The literature review has taken longer than I'd like and will likely continue to. At times
        I find myself hitting walls with the direction I want to take. It's difficult to be writing a piece where you're
        not already entreating on an existing body of work - what you then have to do is take elements from what is
        already written and parse out the relevant parts. You can't exactly abstract hack that.
