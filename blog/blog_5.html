        Digital Literacy: Knowing What You Don't Know

        <p>In my attempts to explain my research to other students in the faculty, I was shocked by how much difficulty I had 
        explaining things that, to me, were incredibly simple. For context: my peers do not understand what a server is. Many 
        don’t realize that a web page is just a document on someone else’s computer. None could tell you the structure of the 
        Internet, even in the most simplistic terms.</p>

        <p>We’re working digitally more than ever before, with digital literacy <a href="#references" style="color: cadetblue;">[1]</a> on the rise (and a 6-fold increase in publications about it since 
        2012 <a href="#references" style="color: cadetblue;">[2]</a>), but our actual digital <i>competence</i> 
        is at an all-time low. Somewhere in the middle we’ve dropped a key principle: how digital spaces, materials, and devices
        actually work. Most people don’t <i>know</i> what they don’t know, either.</p>

        <p>Schools and higher education are less concerned about educating students about how to problem-solve in the digital 
        space and more about how to operate in specific walled gardens chosen by the school or university, 
        and industry groups are inconsistent about what they want from graduates in terms of skills and 
        competencies <a href="#references" style="color: cadetblue;">[3]</a>.</p>
        
        <p>You don’t need to 
        comprehend how a program works on principle – you need to know how <i>our</i> program works, so you can do an assignment, attend
         a class, do a job – it’s a brutally utilitarian approach.   </p>
        
         <p>Even 10 years ago it was more common to have a very, very basic rudimentary understand of webpages, at the very least. 
        Practically everyone I knew had a dabble in HTML coding their Tumblr page (or Neopets, if you were <i>that</i> child. I was that 
        child.) When I was really young, at a time when “computer classes” were a thing, we were taught how to use Adobe Flash and 
        its programming language, AS3.</p>

        <p>Yes, yes, Flash has gone the way of the dodo. I know. And so has the digital hobbyist, on relatively the same timeframe.
        The move to <a href="https://www.themandarin.com.au/163431-the-latest-evidence-on-digital-literacy-inclusion-in-education/" 
        style="color: cadetblue;" target="new">mobile devices</a>
        is likely related to a decline in basic IT understanding, with desktop programs following their mobile counterparts in their 
        hyper-simplicity and rigidity.</p>
    
        <p>Digital literacy, as it’s written about, is about basic usage of the materials and devices, not any meaningful 
        understanding of them. It’d be a bit like if we stopped English classes at basic reading comprehension and had the 
        rest as elective classes. Sounds bad, right? Worse: digital literacy among high-school age kids is declining – the 
        low bar is only getting lower.</p>

        
        <p>When comparing ACARA’s <a href="https://www.teachermagazine.com/au_en/articles/working-from-home-and-digital-literacy-what-can-we-assume?utm_source=CM&utm_medium=Bulletin&utm_content=April7" style="color: cadetblue;" target="new">average ICT literacy scores</a> 
        from 2005-2017, the results are quite pertinent: Year 6 student results peaked in 2011 and have since declined to near-2005 levels. 
        Year 10 students performed better in 2005 by about <i>25 points.</i> It's a concerning trend that naturally causes knock-on effects the
        older these students get and the higher into the education system they move.</p>

        <p>We don’t need a million HDR arts student programmers. We probably don’t even need a hundred. What we need is to be a little more aware 
        of how the Internet is constructed and how our devices work. The only way to teach this is to have people who can bridge the gap between 
        the arts faculty and the STEM faculties. </p>

        <p>Unfortunately such a thing is as rare as a unicorn – and this is why we get the digital literacy approach that we do. It’s either too 
        intensely programmatic, confusing and overwhelming students, or it’s not programmatic enough to allow them to work ‘on the fly’ as they 
        need to without crying at the prospect of trying to operate a Linux machine. (It’s fine to cry <i>while</i> installing, though. Even the 
        most seasoned tech users do that.)</p>

        <p>There’s no goldilocks zone, and there’s not much to be done at the university level. If you don’t have the requisite pattern-matching 
        skills, it becomes increasingly difficult to learn as one become increasingly used to their walled garden (think an Apple user attempting 
        to use the PCs in the computer labs. It’s a massacre.) and is unlikely to respond to intervention at that point. I don’t necessarily 
        blame them – they don’t really need those skills, do they? They’re happy where they are. </p>

        <p>And that’s where the issue really lies – it’s robbing us of academic and personal opportunities. It doesn’t take much to make a simple 
        website – if academics could make and maintain their own websites instead of relying on terrible platforms like Twitter, where one is a 
        skip and a jump from extreme and  <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/twitter-to-avoid-governments-porn-pass-age-test-wmqj27zfs" 
        style="color: cadetblue;" target="new">uncensored pornography</a> (very professional!) – it would do a lot more for a unique online 
        footprint than a single Twitter account in a sea of other accounts that look exactly the same. </p>

        <p>
            Real digital competence can give academics a huge edge in managing their own affairs, without having to do major go-between just to get
            their lofty-idea projects off the ground. Forget commissioning a project website - DIY forever!

        </p>

        <p>(A custom website name on a business card is also extremely flash, which is justification enough.)</p>
