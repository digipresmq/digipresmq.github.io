                        <p><u>The Dataset</u></p>
                        <p style="margin-right: 30px; text-align: justify;">To circumnavigate some complications at this stage, 
                            the data will constitute a ‘dummy’ dataset. 
                        The way I will do this is to set up my own instances on forum software (as there are several legacy 
                        and modern platforms still in use), populate them with dummy data, and demonstrate the scraping 
                        program and database schema using that data. As the data itself is incidental, and establishing 
                        my own forum instances give me unique insight into the way the data is constructed and stored, 
                        this seems like a sensible choice.</p>

                        <p><u>Data Standards</u></p>
                        
                        <p style="margin-right: 30px; text-align: justify;">Data collection will likely be scraped into the database itself, 
                        but outside of this the forms used by the data are likely to be raw .html or HTML content converted to raw text (.txt) 
                        files. Preservation of some .css files for website appearance structure recreation may also be an option.
                        As for the database schema I would prefer a lightweight, non-server-requiring format like 
                        <a href="https://www.litedb.org/" style="color: cadetblue;" target="new">LiteDB</a>. Its syntax 
                        is compatible with existing SQL-style database modes for interoperability purposes, and its FOSS specification 
                        suits the project.</p>

                        <p><u>Metadata</u></p>
                        Metadata scraped from forum software will likely include most of the following:

                        <ul style="margin-left: 30px;">
                        <li>Poster username and ID</li>
                        <li>Date posted</li>
                        <li>Post content</li>
                        <li>Relevant URLs</li>
                        <li>Subforum/thread/post location (URL structure)</li>
                        <li>Location (if recorded on profile)</li>
                        </ul>

                        Additional data at this stage:

                        <br>
                        <p style="margin-left: 30px;">Automated:</p>

                        <ul style="margin-left: 30px;">
                        <li>Date accessed</li>
                        <li>Type of forum software</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p style="margin-left: 30px;">Manual:</p>

                        <ul style="margin-left: 30px;">
                        <li>Type of material</li>
                        <li>Topic keywords/tags</li>
                        </ul>

                        As the project develops the specific types of metadata and what they are used for will be recorded.

                        <p><u>Access to Data/Data Security</u></p>
                        <p>According to the <a href="https://policies.mq.edu.au/document/view.php?id=300" style="color: cadetblue;" target="new">
                            RDMP</a>(18(a)), the data:</p>

                        <p style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px; text-align: justify;"><i>must be deposited in a 
                        discipline-specific, general-purpose, or Macquarie University research 
                        data repository, or in national or international collections, as per good practice in the discipline 
                        and in accordance with any publisher or funder requirements. Dataset-level metadata should be deposited 
                        in the Macquarie University Research Data Repository if data is published elsewhere (including a link 
                        to the data);</i></p>
                        
                        <p style="margin-right: 30px; text-align: justify;">The likely candidate for offsite data repository (as outlined by the University’s list of approved 
                        data platforms) will be the <a href="https://ada.edu.au" style="color: cadetblue;" target="new"><u>Australian Data Archive.</u></a> </p>
                        
                        <p style="margin-right: 30px; text-align: justify;">In accordance with the <a href="https://policies.mq.edu.au/document/view.php?id=302" style="color: cadetblue;" target="new">RDSSS</a>, the dummy data would be classed as ‘general’ (normal, non-high-risk
                         or sensitive data) in terms of the University’s classifications, and a potential real dataset will likely 
                         fall under the ‘publicly available data’ provision, also under the ‘general’ classification. The CC4.0 
                         license is more than adequate for the data.</p>
                        
                        <p style="margin-right: 30px; text-align: justify;">In terms of data security, the project will implement the following procedures:</p>
                        
                        <ul style="margin-left: 30px;">
                        <li>Strong password on devices (crosschecked with resources to ensure no compromised passwords)</li>
                        <li>Encryption on devices holding and harbouring the data</li>
                        <li>Automated backups to both cloud service (more often) and encrypted physical storage medium (less often)</li>
                        
                        </ul>
                        



                        <p><u>Ownership and Licensing</u></p>
                        <p style="margin-right: 30px; text-align: justify;">As a dummy/demonstrative dataset, generally there is nothing to distribute that others could use in any practical way – 
                        though the dataset may be packaged with any future software made by the project to serve for further demonstrative
                         purposes. Because the data is made by the project, and thus Macquarie as the IP holder of the project 
                         (in accordance with the <a href="https://policies.mq.edu.au/document/view.php?id=207" 
                         style="color: cadetblue;" target="new">IPP</a>), would continue to have ownership of that, but there’s no inherent 
                         value in the 
                         data itself outside of its demonstrative use. </p>

                        <p style="margin-right: 30px; text-align: justify;">In terms of commercialization of the programmatic aspect of the project, I would like to be able to adhere
                         to the principle that nothing in the project is to be used for commercial purposes, but this is subject to
                          a waiver by the University on the basis of it being a low-value output. The overall code license for the 
                          project would likely have to come after the conclusion/marking of the thesis, depending on the University’s 
                          policies and procedures.</p>

                        <p style="margin-right: 30px; text-align: justify;">If in the future of the project post-thesis submission I decide to use a real scraped dataset from 
                        real user posts, I would generally have no ownership over that data – it’s a publicly derived resource, 
                        I have only arranged it in a particular way. If anything it belongs to the server owner or the poster 
                        (though this is not exactly defined legally), but in the case of abandoned forums it’s impossible to ask
                         for permission. Depending on the location in which the data is pulled from, in this instance, it may be 
                         liable to takedown requests from posters from nations where the GDPR is active. (These problems should 
                         indicate why I have chosen a dummy dataset, but in any case data would be screen for any potentially
                          identifying information)</p>

                        <p><u>Project Archival/Preservation</u></p>
                        <p style="margin-right: 30px; text-align: justify;">In terms of the data, see the Access to Data section. Development documentation and other miscellaneous 
                        development files will likely be stored in the same place, or another repository as outlined by the University 
                        and the project’s specific faculty department. </p>

                        <p style="margin-right: 30px; text-align: justify;">If available, I will make specific archival materials for future preservation as the policies and procedures allow.</p>
